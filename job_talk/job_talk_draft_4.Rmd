Many scholars have noted that in hunter-gather populations, the number of people involved in fighting can be as much as 40% of the population, but this percentage drops in big state-level societies. 

This drop is used to defend the idea that we are "living in the most peaceable era in our species’ existence”

notes: look at rhe Rladies template for ideas on pics
also, store images in img folder? might make things easier?


see: 
https://alison.rbind.io/post/r-ladies-slides/
and 
https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/static/slides/blogdown-workshop-slides.Rmd

other ideas:
i like the title slide, but maybe the next slide coild have titel as well but as a png file from ppt. MMight look nice

- CHECK IF IT WORKS ON ANOHTER Computer...might need the style shhet..somethig in the insturctiosn talks abut thhis

- think about zoom!
https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/reveal-js-plugins.html


- do a datatable as is below with iris for something



think about background image for a slide::

background-image: url(https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5729/30943501632_eb0b200eed_b.jpg)
class: center, top
# Rock Cairn Hiking

this could also work  for the maps i have. have the background be the map and the transisotns be the artifcats? also could work for the time line? 


other things to tink about and trick below are from these notes:
these notes are super useful too:
https://dukeslides.johnlittle.info/slides/index.html#37


to change background use "class: duke-orange"

- by wrapping the left-hand text in `.pull-left[` foo `]`

- TAGS &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.pull-right[

## Coloured content boxes

Use `.content-box-blue` (or gray/grey, duke-green, green, purple, red, or yellow) to produce a box with coloured background. Size depends on content.

`.content-box-blue[I feel blue]` yields

.content-box-blue[I feel blue]

Wrap in `.full-width` to expand the width

.full-width[.content-box-red[I feel wide and red]]

If you have content in columns then you get

.pull-left[.full-width[.content-box-yellow[**WARNING** Look out for minons or bananas]]]
.pull-right[.full-width[.content-box-yellow[The box to the left was created using `.pull-left[.full-width[.content-box-yellow[]]]`]]]


---

## Coloured content boxes

Use `.content-box-blue` to produce a box with blue background. Size depends on content.  color has the following options:  `.content-box-color` where color is   blue | gray | grey | neutral | duke-green | green | purple | red | yellow

&amp;nbsp;

.content-box-blue[blue]
